# Nickel2.js
ðŸ”¶ **Note:**

*OK so this project is getting kind of out of hand... I just wanted to make a simple update that was a tad bit better than the original Nickel.js, turns out there is a ton more to game engines than I realized! I will be using Require.js to better organize everything, but I will also have a minimized version for quick use in the future.*

ðŸ”¶

A complete overhaul of the original Real Time Strategy (RTS) Game Engine, 'Nickel.js'.

Currently in the making.

Will no longer require simpleGame.js.

### Main Features So Far:

 - Basic Sprite engine with full transformation support
 
 - Basic Map transformation support (translate, rotate, scale)
 
 - Tiled Map creation (no editor yet)
 
   - Basic sprite placement implemented
   
   - Basic accessibility of placed objects
 
 - Bounding Box and other simple shapes
 
 - Collision support with multiple variants and optional QuadTree optimizations
 
 - Simplified Game Loop
 
 - Viewport object supports simplifying access to the following events:
  
   - Scroll
   
   - Mouse
   
   - Keyboard
   
 - AI Agent Motor/Behavior Capabilities with basic 2D physics
 
 - Pathfinding for multiple applications (un-optimized)
 
 - Simple Line-Of-Sight function (un-optimized)
